speech-translation-tools
========================

A collection of several instruments to collect data in experiments about speech translation. Each branch refers to a different technology.

This branch uses Skype4Java API as the communication channel (both voice and text as the back channel). ASR and MT technologies of choice are Google's. For the captured text to be played back, we are still to find a voice synthesis technology that supports English, Italian and Portugues at once.
